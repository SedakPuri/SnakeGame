A basic console based C++ implementation of the classic game "Snake" where the player is a snake (or a line) that elongates whenever the user consumes "food". The game is over if the line/snake attempts to consume itself. 

This version uses pointers and a queue linked-list that represents the snake as it moves around the board.

**Note: Future versions may utilize C++ Graphical Libraries such as OpenGL and GLUT**
