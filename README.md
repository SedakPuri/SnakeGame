A basic console based C++ implementation of the classic game "Snake" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) where the player is a snake (or a line) that elongates whenever the user consumes "food". The game is over if the line/snake attempts to consume itself. 

_This version uses pointers and a linked-list queue that represents the snake as it moves around the board._

**Note: Future versions may utilize C++ Graphical Libraries such as OpenGL and GLUT**
